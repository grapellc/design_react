## Using Grape Design

Grape Design is available across multiple platforms. This site is the single source for design guidelines and specs. Platform-specific libraries (e.g. React) are built on these specs.

- Figma (when available)
- [React (Web)](/react)
- Android (when available)
- iOS (when available)

All platforms share the same design language (tokens, components). You can move faster and keep design and development consistent.

### React

The React library includes layout primitives (Box, Flex, Grid, Stack, Text), UI components, and icons. See the [React docs](/react) for installation and usage.
