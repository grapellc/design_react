# Getting started with Stackflow

To use the [`AppScreen`](/react/stackflow/app-screen) component with [Stackflow](https://stackflow.so/), add the Stackflow plugin to your app.

Learn more about the AppScreen component.

The plugin provides:

- **Theme context** — Passes `theme` to all `AppScreen` components.
- **Global interactions** — Manages swipe-back gesture and transition state.

## Installation

Install the Stackflow integration package:

```bash
pnpm add @seed-design/stackflow @stackflow/react
```

## Usage

Add the plugin when configuring Stackflow:

```tsx
import { stackflow } from "@stackflow/react/future";
import { seedPlugin } from "@seed-design/stackflow";

export const { Stack, actions } = stackflow({
  plugins: [
    seedPlugin({ theme: "cupertino" }),
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
});
```

Options such as `theme` (`"android" | "cupertino"`) are passed to all `AppScreen` components by default.
