# Manual installation

Install the package:

```bash
pnpm add @grapu-design/react
# or
npm install @grapu-design/react
```

Import the CSS in your app entry (e.g. `main.tsx` or `app/layout.tsx`):

```tsx
import "@grapu-design/react/styles.css";
```

You can now use components from `@grapu-design/react`.
