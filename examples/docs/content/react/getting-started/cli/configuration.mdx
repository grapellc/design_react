# Configuration

CLI behavior can be configured via a config file in the project root (e.g. `grape-design.json` or similar). Check the repository for the exact schema and options.

Common options include:

- **path** — Output directory for generated files
- **tsx** — Use TypeScript
- **rsc** — React Server Components support
