# Theming

Grape Design React uses design tokens and CSS variables. Import the base styles:

```tsx
import "@grape-design/react/styles.css";
```

For color mode (light/dark), ensure your app wraps the tree with a theme provider if your design system supports it. Component tokens follow the same variables as Seed Design.
