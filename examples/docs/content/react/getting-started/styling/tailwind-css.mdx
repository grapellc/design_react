# Tailwind CSS

Import the base styles in your entry file:

```tsx
import "@grapu-design/react/styles.css";
```

Grape Design React components use design tokens that work alongside Tailwind. You can use Tailwind for layout and utilities while using Grape components for UI. See component docs for the design tokens and classes used by each component.
