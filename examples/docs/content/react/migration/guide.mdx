# Migration guide

When upgrading between major or minor versions:

1. Check the [Changelog](/react/updates/changelog) for breaking changes.
2. Run codemods when available (see [Developer Tools](/react/developer-tools/codemods/introduction)).
3. Update imports and APIs according to the release notes.

For icon migration, see [Migrating icons](/react/migration/migrating-icons).
